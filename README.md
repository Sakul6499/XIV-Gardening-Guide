## Step 0: Prepations

We need:  
1x _Deluxe Garden Patch_
3x _Old World Fig Seeds_ (buy from MB or gather, easy to get!)
5x _Mirror Apple Seeds_ (buy from MB or gather, easy to get!)
8x T3S

## Step 1: _Royal Kukuru_ Branch

Put down the _Deluxe Garden Patch_ and plant it like this:

```text
 MA  | [OW] |  MA
------------------
 MA  |  XX  |  MA
------------------
[OW] |  MA  | [OW]
```

MA = Mirror Apple Seeds
OW = Old World Fig Seeds
[] = Stays / one time!

First plant the Old World Fig Seeds with T3S, then Mirror Apple Seeds with T3S.
Wait 4-5 days, water everyday and optionally fertilize to make them grow faster.
(* fertilizing has no effect on cross breeds or yield, just makes it grow faster)

**ONLY** harvest the Mirror Apple's and let the Old World Fig's alone.
If done correctly we should see a yield of about 96%, given we have 5 Mirror Apple spots, that should be 4-5x Royal Kukuru Seeds.

## Step 2: _Thavnarian Onion_ Branch

We need:  

1x _Garden Patch_ (*)
3x _Tantaplant Seeds_ (buy from MB or cross Krakka Root with Wizard Eggplant beforehand)
5x Royal Kukuru Seeds (from previous step)
8x T3S

> (*) Either you swap the previous _Deluxe Garden Patch_ with the new one or you place down both at once.
> S-Size plots can only have one Garden Patch, M-Size two, L-Size three.
> On M and L-Size you can decide if you want quicker returns (at least one for Step 1, at least one for step 2), or higher yields (two for each step and swap).
> **DO NOT** remove the _Old World Fig's_ from the previous _Deluxe Garden Patch_, but store it!

Put down the _Deluxe Garden Patch_ and plant it like this:

```text
 RK  | [TP] |  RK
------------------
 RK  |  XX  |  RK
------------------
[TP] |  RK  | [TP]
```

RK = Royal Kukuru
TP = Tantaplant
[] = Stays / one time!

First plant the Tantaplant Seeds with T3S, then the Royal Kukuru Seeds with T3S.
Wait 4-5 days, water everyday and optionally fertilize to make them grow faster.
(* fertilizing has no effect on cross breeds or yield, just makes it grow faster)

**ONLY** harvest the Royal Kukuru's, leave the Tantaplant alone.
If done correctly, we should see a yield of about 60%. Given 5x Royal Kukuru's we should see about 3x _Thavnarian Onion Seeds_.

## Step 3: _Thavnarian Onion_

We need:

2-3x Planters (from housing merchant)
2-3x _Thavnarian Onion Seeds_ (from previous step!)

While we could plant them on a _Deluxe Garden Patch_, they are very valuable at about 100k per seed.
To avoid any cross breeding and randomness ruining your day, plant them inside a house in planters.
Wait 4-5 days, water every day, optionall fertilize to make them grow faster.
(* fertilizing has no effect on yield, just makes them grow faster)

Once done, harvest and sell on MB for about 150k each.
This method will yield about 3x _Thavnarian Onion_ per 8-10 days, per _Deluxe Garden Patch_.
Thus, about 450k per 8-10 days, per _Deluxe Garden Patch_.

> Note: While the _Thavnarian Onion_ are growing in pots, we can return to Step 1 by exchanging the _Deluxe Garden Patch_ again and making new _Royal Kakaru Seeds_.
> Once the _Thavnarian Onions_ are done, we can start with Step 2 again and repeat the process.
> With M/L-Size plots it's possible to grow _Thavnarian Onion_ every growing interval (4-5 days).

## Yields:

| Plot Size | Onions per interval | Gil per interval |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| S-Size    | ~3x                 | ~450k            |
| M-Size    | ~6x                 | ~900k            |
| L-Size    | ~9x                 | ~1350k           |
